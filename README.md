Project Name: Nearby Pubs Finder

Description:
The "Nearby Pubs Finder" project aims to provide users with a convenient way to find nearby pubs based on their current latitude and longitude coordinates. The project leverages location data and mapping APIs to retrieve information about pubs in proximity to a given location. Users can input their latitude and longitude, and the system will display a list of nearby pubs along with their details such as name, address.

Key Features:

User Input: Users can input their latitude and longitude coordinates to initiate the search for nearby pubs.
API Integration: The project integrates with mapping and location APIs (such as Google Maps API) to obtain information about nearby pubs.
Distance Calculation: The system calculates the distance between the user's location and each pub using mathematical formulas like the Haversine formula or built-in distance functions provided by the API.
Pub Retrieval: Using the obtained location data, the project retrieves details about nearby pubs, including their names, addresses.
Map Visualization: The project may include a visual representation of the nearby pubs on a map to enhance the user experience and provide a better understanding of their locations.


Programming Language: The project can be implemented using a suitable programming language such as Python, Flask.

This project offers a practical solution for users who are looking to explore nearby pubs based on their current location. It provides an intuitive and interactive way to find and discover pubs in proximity, enabling users to make informed decisions about their leisure and social activities. The source code and documentation in this repository can serve as a valuable resource for developers interested in building similar location-based applications or integrating mapping and location APIs into their projects.
